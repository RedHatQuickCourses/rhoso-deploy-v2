= Install control plane

The OpenStack Operator functions as the main operator for Red Hat OpenStack 18 deployment. 
It acts as a "meta" operator, overseeing and configuring other operators for OpenStack by monitoring and managing their CustomResources (CRs). 
Moreover, installing this operator will automatically set up all necessary operator dependencies for installing and managing OpenStack.
