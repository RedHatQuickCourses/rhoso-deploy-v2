= Preparing RHOCP for RHOSP Network Isolation

Network confiuration for the nodes is facilated by the below operators.

*NMState operator* _facilitates network configuration for the nodes of the cluster._
`NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` offered by nmstate operator allows you to configure network settings on individual nodes in a network. 
This policy can be used to set network interfaces, routing tables, firewall rules, and other network-related settings. 

*Multus CNI plugin* _facilitates the network configuration for the pods running control plane services for the cluster._
`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) is a feature offered by the Multus CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin. 
NAD is used to define network attachment points and states for network devices, allowing for automatic fencing and management of those devices. 

*MetalLB operator* _offers load blaancing service for OCP baremetal cluster._
`IPAddressPool` and `L2Advertisement` CRs offered by MetalLB operator facilitates IP advertisement from specified pools, ensuring efficient IP allocation to services and namespaces. 
By leveraging these custom resources, OpenShift facilitates efficient communication between nodes within the cluster, promoting seamless integration and performance optimization in networking-intensive environments.
