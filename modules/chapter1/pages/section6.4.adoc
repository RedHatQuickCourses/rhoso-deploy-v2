= Troubleshoot the Data Plane deployment

**Troubleshooting data plane deployment:**

Follow below steps to track the progress with the data plane deployment and troubleshoot it.

. Check the status of the deployment, it is in progress.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get openstackdataplanedeployments.dataplane.openstack.org 
oc get openstackdataplanenodesets.dataplane.openstack.org

Make note of the job in progress (not completed) in the above output.

. Check the logs of running job to track it's progress and investigate any failure.

**Troubleshooting networking on compute node:**

Netwroking setup of the data plane deployment could be error prone while you are tweaking your YAML files.
You may loose the connectivity of the compute node due to any misconfiguration in the files.
You may need to tweak the data plane network configuration files for appropriate networking setup (os-net-config) on the compute node.


If you are encountering errors related to any network related job, follow these steps:

. Access the compute node and review `/etc/os-net-confg/config.yaml`.
. Make necessary tweaks and run `os-net-config` command manually.
. Repeate above step until you get the networking setup as desired.
. You may loose the network access to the compute node due to application of misconfigured os-net-config settings.
. You may access the node over the console if it is not reachable on the network.
. Reset the network settings of the compute node with below steps:
.. Log in to the compute node as the root user via console.
.. Delete OVS bridges:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ovs-vsctl del-br br-osp
ovs-vsctl del-br br-ex
----

.. Delete current network configuration files:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
rm -f /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
----

.. Reboot the compute node to restore network connectivity.

. Once a working configuration is achieved, update related changes in `osp-ng-dataplane-node-set-deploy.yaml` and `osp-ng-dataplane-netconfig.yaml` as per requirement.
. Apply the settings using `oc apply` command.


**Re-run Data Plane Deployment:**

During troubleshooting, if needed, delete the existing data plane deployment and re-run it:

Deleting the data plane node set and deployment will clean up all the related jobs and associated pods and you may start from scratch.

. Delete existing deployment:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc delete -f osp-ng-dataplane-deployment.yaml
oc delete -f osp-ng-dataplane-node-set-deploy.yaml
----

. Re-run the deployment:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-dataplane-node-set-deploy.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-dataplane-deployment.yaml
----
