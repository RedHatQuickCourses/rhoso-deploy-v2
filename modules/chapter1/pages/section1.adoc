= Introduction

Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) is an infrastructure-as-a-service product offered by Red Hat. 
Until version 17.1, Red Hat OpenStack deployment utilized the TripleO project ("OpenStack On OpenStack"). 
However, the current Red Hat OpenStack product differs from both the community OpenStack and previous releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

With RHOSP version 18, we are moving away from TripleO deployment and introducing Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift (RHOSO). Now, the deployment of OpenStack is managed using a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) cluster. All control plane services are now containerized and run on the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

In this training, we will follow step-by-step instructions to deploy RHOSP 18 using a pre-existing OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
