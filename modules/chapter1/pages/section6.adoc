= Create data plane

In this section we will deploy the data plane with a pre-provisioned compute node in our RHOSP cluster.

We will use `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CRD to define the nodes and the layout of the data plane.
We will trigger the deployment process with `OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` custom resource.
